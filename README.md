# Hello-World
Learning GitHub and linking to my RStudio! 
Now I can add more details about my repository as I learn the basic instructions. 

These further edits are to demonstrate how branches work - create a copy of the main branch, and allow me to make changes in here that do not affect the main branch. 
Apprarently, the new edits are called commits. 

To connect this repo to RStudio, I copied the repo URL and pasted it in the Git slot after creating a new project with version control in RStudio. The new project automatically took the name of the repo and downloaded the file(s) i.e. this .md file, that was in my repo for viewing within RStudio.
