# Hello-World
Learning GitHub and linking to my RStudio! 
Now I can add more details about my repository as I learn the basic instructions. 

These further edits are to demonstrate how branches work - create a copy of the main branch, and allow me to make changes in here that do not affect the main branch. 
Apprarently, the new edits are called commits.
